# algorithm-practice
I wanted to practice implementing various algorithms in the languages I am most familiar with


To run the C++ sorter, navigate to the cpp folder and type:
> g++ -std=c++17 sorter.cpp algorithms.cpp
> 
and then after compilation, to run type:
> a.exe

The output of the sorting algorithms will be in a new file called "output.txt"
